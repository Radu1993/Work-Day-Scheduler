# 07 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
## Description
I have tryed to create a calendar application that allows user to save an events for each hour of the day but I couldn't make it to save it even if I tryed many ways.

## Installation 
The application runs in the browser and the website can be viewed at : 
https://github.com/Radu1993/Work-Day-Scheduler.git

 IT'S  DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY INSTALLATION TO RUN!

 ## Usage 
 The application help the user to schedule an event if the user have a busy program and it's help to mangage the time easier.
